# FRC-CAD-Files Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to this repository, the following guidelines should be kept in mind: 

* Make sure the files that you are adding were **made by our team**
* In the correct folder, or the correct folder/subfolder is created
* It does not already exist inside this repository
* The files and folders added match our naming scheme (TBD, use [PascalCase](http://wiki.c2.com/?PascalCase) for now).

As long as the above three points are kept in mind and followed as best as possible, any contribution submitted should be good to go!
